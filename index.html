<h1>Demiurge</h1>
<div class="subtitle">By Duo Studios</div>
<p>Welcome, young traveller. Rumour has it that some human crash-landed on this planet before you did. The nerve of the guy! This is <i>our</i> crash site! But before you contemplate how to enjoy the rest of your painful stranded life, some armored creature calling himself 'Demiurge' is already offering you a helping hand with your very immediate escape, by means of pure force. This would be helpful, if that escape in question wasn't death, and he wasn't trying to kill you.</p>

<p>Fortunately, a wannabe villain so bumbling as Demiurge only reveals weaknesses in the cultural hiearchy of this planet of strange creatures. For one thing, while they worship him for his seemingly godlike modern technologies, they don't seem to like him as much as... well... he does; and resultedly your popularity seems to be growing the more you treat the creatures as soulful sentient beings. Perhaps there is hope after all for you to escape the peaceful way, but not before giving Demiurge a taste of his own medicine!</p>

<p>Featuring karma-based combat where peaceful and deflective fighting styles will win over the natives of this lost planet, Demiurge is an action-story sci-fi game with a funny tone and a feeling of player participation. You play as Yourself, a boring regular individual with a fairly unremarkable face and a proneness to stare at computer screens and read the Internet (with a particularly good taste in blog posts, such as this one).</p>

<h1>Gameplay</h1>
<p>The gameplay of this prototype is designed to be simple and accessible. You are equipped with a <b>shield</b> and a <b>laser gun</b>. To give yourself a fighting chance, use your <b>shield</b> to deflect enemy shots back at them. Defeating enemies with their own projectiles, or each other's, earns you <b>karma</b>. <b>Karma</b> charges your weaopn, making the shots much more powerful.</p>

<p>As an innocent traveller, your only role in this game is to survive. However, to survive you must give the misguided population a taste of their own medicine.</p>

<h1>The Programming Team: Louis</h1>
<p>Hi there! I'm Louis. Let me introduce you to my role in the development of Demiurge. Actually, truth be told, there are many. For example, I've broken the engine enough times to deserve a new role of fulfilling the the team's GDP quota (Generally Destructive Person). But I'm asked not to talk about that, particularly by myself, who wishes to be correctly recognised as the most fabulous and amazing person ever.</p>

<p>Working in Unreal with inexperienced C++ programmers was a strange experience. Though my first contribution was to write a dialogue system entirely in C++, ultimately I found myself inserting it into a project written almost entirely in Blueprints. More on this to come.</p>

<p>The game follows a traditional hiearchy: Player and enemy subclasses inherit from a base character with movement and physics components. Control of the character types, also known as 'pawns', is handled with character controllers: classes which control the actions of a character, in such a way that a character could be reused by AI, the player, or a networked player.</p>

<p>However, as of this writing, I notice that player control is actually handled through its pawn class, rather than a controller. This is unconventional. Yet in this ultimately small-scale game demo made by inexperienced students, the decision could be justified in the fact that we don't need to create several pawn character functions, only to be called once by another blueprint. This makes debugging much easier and quicker in the short term, as the blueprints are all available in one place.</p>

<p>However, for a game with more expandable potential, it would certainly be advisable to move the player control code to a character controller. We may, for example, wish to introduce cutscene sequences where the player moves around, driven by another character controller.</p>

<p>Our general understanding as a team was that Unreal doesn't provide any particular means of delivering scripted dialogue, besides basic user interfaces. As a story-based game with initially high ambitions, dialogue was considered a key component of the player experience. To fill this empty hole in the system, I wrote a C++ interpreter of 'Inky(tm)' style scripts. The interpreter is split into the following components:</p>

<p>* CharacterControllerWithDialogue: This is the player character controller, except it additionally implements DialogueScript pointers to enable it to display dialogue to the screen.<br>
* DialogueScriptFactory: This adds .txt files into Unreal, and when loaded, passes them to construction functions in DialogueScript.<br>
* DialogueScript: This is the main script class. So that it can be edited in the Unreal Editor by the writer, the script is still stored in raw text form. Effectively, it is simply a large string describing the contents of the script.<br>
* DialogueScene: This is where the script is finally processed. It exposes a function named LoadScript(??), which loads and parses a DialogueScript object. During parsing, a small set of helper functions (StringParseHelper::...) aid in converting the script to DialogueActions. Following that, functions such as Continue() process the script, returning DialogueActions to the character controller that calls it.<br>
* DialogueAction: This class describes an 'action' as part of a scripted scene. This can include 'Speak' actions, which display character-spoken text to the screen, or 'Choice' actions, which display choices to the player. Ultimately, the game only ever implemented the Speak functionality, so it might have been more appropriate to call this type a DialogueQuote.</p>

<p>Retrospectively, some of these components could be restructured. On one hand, CharacterControllerWithDialogue did use DialogueScenes to process dialogue--which is sufficient for a project of this scale--but when it came to displaying it on the screen, CharacterControllerWithDialogue took that responsibility. This violates the class responsibility(??) principle. I believe DialogueScene should be the object to do this.</p>

<p>In fact, DialogueScene could be further be split into DialogueScene and DialogueProcessor. The former could handle the dialogue display and flow, while the latter could store the actual dialogue data and provide it to DialogueScene.</p>

<p>The fact that the dialogue system was the only one I wrote in C++ may raise eyebrows. This is because the rest of the game was being made in Blueprints. Noting a lack of team C++ experience, its crash proneness, long compile times, and the fact that several computers refused to compile it entirely, I believe that was almost certainly the more productive decision concerning player experience (disappoint some lecturers as it may). As such I took a conscious decision not to nag my team mates to use my favourite language.</p>

<h1>The Programming Team: Tomas</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Tomas, playing a programming role in this team. Although I'm not as experienced programmer as other my mates, but Unreal gives a good feature to make a lot of stuff with blueprints. And that's what I did the most.</p>
		
<p>First thing I did for the game was write a base class for all characters - player and enemies - which included health variable, damage and the way health is calculated when damaged. This was written in the C++ code, which is the only one I did, unfortunately.</p>
	
<p>Nonetheless, I was working mainly on the AI of the game, making different types of enemies - melee, shooting and explosive ones, which like to die themselves while taking the player with them. I was using behaviour trees together with AIControllers to all of the enemies, except for the shield ones, because they just need to stand still and deflect the players bullets. I was writing tasks, decorators and services for these behaviour trees, which provided a more precise AI behaviour.</p>
		
<p>Besides AI I also wrote most of the player controls and player-related things, such as camera rotation, equipment and inventory systems (which, unfortunately, are not used in the game).
